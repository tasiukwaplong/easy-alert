# EASY ALERT

## About Project
This project is built for the DSC SOlution Challenge and aims to solve problem of information dissimination in Fedral University of Lafia.  
The team (of DSC FULafia) thought of a way of passing information to students in real time and void of all major communication barriers faced in information dissimintaion. Easy alert sends SMS notification to students immediately the information is passed by the authorized sender.  
The system allows for students to subscribe to topics they wish to get notified on and messages are charged from receiver (i.e. after choosing topics they wish to subscribe to, they make payment and each message recieved, the fee will be deducted from reveiver account).
